Design Decisions
Wireframes
***Link***
The design of the website was intentionally crafted to provide a visually comfortable experience, minimizing strain on the userâ€™s eyes while highlighting important information with the use of color. The layout adheres to modern web design principles, ensuring clarity and ease of use.

Font and Spacing Choices
The font size, line height, and letter spacing were carefully selected to optimize readability. By creating sufficient space between lines and characters, users can comfortably read the content without feeling overwhelmed by densely packed text.

Homepage Carousel
On the homepage, a carousel component was implemented to allow users to quickly glance through the website's main features without excessive scrolling. This design choice enhances user engagement by offering easy navigation. Additionally, the automatic scrolling feature was disabled, allowing users to control the pace of content consumption. This ensures that they can fully absorb the information at their own speed before moving on.

Accordion for Methods Page
On the "Methods" page, an accordion component was used to efficiently organize information. This enables users to selectively expand sections to view the content relevant to them, avoiding an overwhelming display of all information at once. The accordion structure helps maintain a clean, structured appearance while offering quick access to details.

Resource Cards
The "Resources" page is equipped with a card component, providing users with a brief overview of each available resource. The card layout not only organizes information efficiently but also offers a visually appealing way for users to scan through different resources and select the ones that interest them most. This structure keeps the page from becoming cluttered, promoting a smooth browsing experience.

By blending user-friendly components like the carousel, accordion, and cards with thoughtful typography and color use, the website ensures a seamless and engaging user experience.

Accessibility Considerations
Discuss how accessibility guidelines were adhered to, including colour contrast and alt text for images.
Guidance: Outline how you've incorporated accessibility into your design, ensuring that your project adheres to guidelines such as WCAG.
