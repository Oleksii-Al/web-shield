                            <strong>Ransomware</strong> is a dangerous type of malware that locks your files and demands
                            a ransom to get
                            them back. Fortunately, there are simple steps you can take to protect yourself from
                            becoming a victim. Follow these tips to stay safe and keep your data secure.

                            <strong>Phishing</strong> is a common cyber attack where hackers try to trick you into
                            giving up personal
                            information, like passwords or bank details, by pretending to be someone you trust.
                            Thankfully, there are simple ways to recognize and avoid these scams. Here are some tips to
                            keep your data safe.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always hover over links in emails before clicking to check if the URL looks suspicious
                                or unfamiliar.</li>
                            <li>Look for slight spelling errors or unusual characters in the sender’s email address
                                (e.g., support@emai1.com instead of support@email.com).</li>
                            <li>Avoid clicking on “urgent” messages claiming your account is in danger—always log in
                                directly through the official website.</li>
                            <li>Enable email filters to block known phishing sources from reaching your inbox.</li>
                            <li>Set up two-factor authentication on your accounts to make it harder for hackers to
                                access them, even with your password.</li>
                            <li>Regularly review your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you receive a suspicious email or message, contact the company using their official
                                phone number or website, not the information provided in the email.</li>

                            information, or
                            take control of your system without your permission. It often spreads through infected
                            files, websites, or apps, but with the right steps, you can protect yourself and your
                            devices.

                            <li>Avoid clicking on pop-up ads or suspicious links on websites, as they can lead to
                                malware infections.</li>
                            <li>Keep your operating system and apps up to date, as updates often include important

                            <li>Install reputable antivirus software and regularly run scans to detect and remove

                            <li>Be cautious with email attachments, especially from unknown senders — they might contain
                                malware.</li>
                            <li>Disable automatic downloads in your browser to avoid downloading infected files without
                                realizing it.</li>
                            <li>Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication to make it harder for malware
                                to spread through your accounts.</li>

                            <strong>Social Engineering</strong> is a tactic used by cybercriminals to manipulate
                            individuals into revealing personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
                            These attacks often rely on psychological tricks and can be difficult to spot. By being
                            aware and cautious, you can protect yourself from these deceptive tactics.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be skeptical of unsolicited messages or phone calls asking for personal information,
                                even if they appear to be from a trusted source.</li>
                            <li>Verify identities by contacting the person or organization directly using official
                                contact information, not the details provided in the message.</li>
                            <li>Avoid sharing personal information on social media, as attackers can use this
                                information to craft convincing scams.</li>
                            <li>Think before you click on links or attachments in emails, especially if you didn’t
                                expect to receive them.</li>
                            <li>Educate yourself and others about common social engineering tactics, like phishing and
                                pretexting, to recognize potential threats.</li>
                            <li>Use strong passwords and change them regularly to minimize damage if your information is

                            <strong>Vulnerabilities in Web Applications and Networks</strong> can have security
                            weaknesses that cybercriminals may exploit to gain unauthorized access to sensitive
                            information. Understanding these vulnerabilities and how to protect against them is crucial
                            for safeguarding your data and maintaining a secure online presence.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regularly update web applications and frameworks to ensure you have the latest security
                                patches and fixes.</li>
                            <li>Implement strong authentication methods, such as two-factor authentication, to add an
                                extra layer of security for users.</li>
                            <li>Use secure coding practices when developing web applications to minimize vulnerabilities
                                from the start.</li>
                            <li>Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address
                                potential weaknesses in your systems.</li>
                            <li>Limit user access to sensitive areas of your web application to only those who need it,
                                reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
                            <li>Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect it from interception or
                                theft.</li>
                            <li>Monitor network traffic for unusual activity that could indicate a security breach or
                                attempted attack.</li>
